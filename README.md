# orbify
For Unprepared Casters listeners (or anyone really) who want to orbify their names. Orb is life!

Perfect for long or complicated names, or people who just don't have the time to orbify themselves. It's really just as simple as this:
  1. Enter the text you want orbified in the labelled entry window
  2. Click "Orbify!"
  3. See your orbified text appear in the text box below!
  
No fancy bells or whistles. I made this *during* the post-Arc 4 stream so it's not the most efficiently laid out code, but it orbifies!

Happy orbing!
